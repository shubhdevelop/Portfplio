## Introduction

Modern development is like multiverse of complacency, point and click, accept accept accept,
and AI generated bloat. Everything seems to be on steroids; shipping, code gen,
and thus bugs too. You give a prompt; it fixes it. You read the generated code,
you seem to understand it, you verify it, accept it, commit it, and raise a PR.
You get it merged and mark the ticket "DONE." Awesome. Job done.

In this process what did one learn? can we reproduce our changes without AI?``
Are we aware of the edge cases AI just gave? Would we catch it again if the next time AI did not provide it?
Most mid and junior-level folks like me can’t.

Not because we don’t understand the flow of code, but simply because we avoid the pain of repetition.
All novel ideas are the result of deliberate effort and repetition;
all breakthroughs are the result of painstakingly deliberate and repetitive experiments.

## Vim: The Savior

A tool so old that the WWW had just been announced when it was created.
We are talking about a tool that has passed the test of time so thoroughly that history favored its motion, **Vim**.

Vim isn't just a text editor; it is poetry written with motion, and the writer is you.
It is art in practice; it wires the brain to seek hard things and master them.
It does not ask anything, it demands from you:

- To not accept the status quo
- To ditch the cursor for once
- To choose hardship
- To fight complacency
- To own your learning
- To accept no hand-holding

Like all saviors that have blessed us, they all possess powers. Vim is no different.
We call them **Motions**. Some are more useful than others, but all are important.
It's power is not in grandeur, but in small, calculated, deliberate efforts.
You stop moving fast; instead, you execute with finesse. Now, you seek more with less.
Something has changed. You are taking more time than ever for the simplest of actions.

It seems hard at first. You didn't quit; you marched on. As a result, you are now different.
You no longer seek the easy path; you have proven your worth to yourself.
The world works on proof, not affirmations. You have saved yourself and set yourself apart.
Every day, you keep improving your art, your poetry, your combat skills, whatever metaphor you prefer.

You freed yourself from the chains of suggestion, something finally came out of your mind.
something to be proud of of and celebrate, this victory does not feel given, it feels earned
,with hardship and deliberate efforts

## Conclusion

This write-up is not about Vim in particular, but rather the idea of learning and
fighting status quo, Doing the things deliberately and hard way.
Not because you are a revolutionary, but simply because the status quo is complacent
and filled with hand holding. It acts as a reminder that we have a blessing to choose our hardship,
and so we choose Vim.
